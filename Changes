0.0.3  Fri Apr 13 20:30:47 2007

    - Fixed test suite
      (Removed YAML dependency;
       Instead of line-by-line comparison of serializations, the
       tests now walk the expected and actual DOM representations in parallel,
       comparing node values via the objects' accessor methods;
       This version of the test suite could easily be adapted to any
       implementation of Pod parsing. Look at the 'make_tests' program and
       the 't_source' directory to see how the tests are now declaratively
       specified and auto-generated.
      )

        * balanced all <a>..</a> tags

    - Made XHTML strict conforming:

0.0.5  Wed Apr 25 18:24:46 2007

    - Enhanced Perl6::Perldoc::Parser::parse() so that it now accepts either
      a filename, a filehandle, or a reference to a string, as its data
      source.

    - Several doc tweaks (thanks John)

    - Added is_verbatim() method to DOM

    - Fixed propagation of config info into table cells (thanks John!)

    - Improved robustness of table parsing with respect to single/double
      horizontal lines (e.g. no longer treats isolated =>, ==, --, etc.
      as possible vertical boundary components)

    - Fixed bug in DTD generation under 'full_doc' option

    - Add embedded style_sheet support

    - [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE] Refactored 'full_doc' option with
      'DTD', 'title', and 'style' suboptions
      
    - Added stylesheet to bin/perldoc2xhtml to improve rendering of tables
      in Firefox, Safari, and Explorer

    - Added -toc option to bin/perldoc2xhtml to autogenerate a table of
      contents for the document

    - Added 'text_to_entities' option: see bin/perldoc2xhtml_enhanced
      for an example (thanks John)
